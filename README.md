# Radom Docs(README)

### This repository contains a collection of funny and useful dummy documents that I often need to search for on Google. 
#### I've decided to gather all my usual questions in a random readme file and share them here. 

## Table of Contents

1. [Python](./python.md)
2. [Databases](./databases.md)
3. [OOP](./OOP.md)
4. [Design Pattern](./design_pattern.md)
4. [Vim](./vim.md)
5. [Books](./books.md)
6. [Design Principles](./design_principles.md)

#### Feel free to contact me if you'd like to contribute or edit these documents.
