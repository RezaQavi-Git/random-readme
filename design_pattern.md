# Design Pattern

### Definition

Design patterns are design level solutions for recurring problems that we software engineers come across often.

### Types of Design Patterns

1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others. 

3. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. 

### Examples
- Type 1: Creational - The Singleton Design Pattern

    The Singleton Design Pattern is a Creational pattern, whose objective is to create only one instance of a class and to provide only one global access point to that object. 

- Type 2: Structural - The Decorator Design Pattern

    The decorator design pattern falls into the structural category, that deals with the actual structure of a class, whether is by inheritance, composition or both. The goal of this design is to modify an objectsâ€™ functionality at runtime. 

- Type 3: Behavioral - The Command Design Pattern

    A behavioral design pattern focuses on how classes and objects communicate with each other. The main focus of the command pattern is to inculcate a higher degree of loose coupling between involved parties
