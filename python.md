## Python Decorators Summary

Decorators dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method, or class without having to directly use subclasses or change the source code of the function being decorated. Using decorators in Python also ensures that your code is DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself). Decorators have several use cases such as:

- Authorization in Python frameworks such as Flask and Django
- Logging
- Measuring execution time
- Synchronization
